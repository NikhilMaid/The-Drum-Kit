# The-Drum-Kit
Welcome to the Drum Kit project! This is a simple web development project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project simulates a virtual drum kit that you can play using your computer keyboard. Each key corresponds to a different drum element, producing a unique sound when pressed.
